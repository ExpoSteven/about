# about

# I'm ExpoSteven, and I love learning about all kinds of things.
# My mind is mechanically inclined, but it also translates well to abstract things like programming.
# I just started working for ExpoBadge, and this is my work account.
# Excited to get into this machine and smooth things out as much as possible.
